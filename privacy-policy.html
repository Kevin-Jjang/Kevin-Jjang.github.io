<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last Updated on August 10, 2021</p>
<p class="reading-length">4 minute read</p>
Kevin Jang is committed to protecting the privacy of his viewers while providing transparency with how he collects data.
This privacy policy is meant to be educational and welcoming for users to read and learn about privacy on the internet.
<h2 class="rem1-2">What Information Do I Collect From You?</h2>
I implement Google Analytics to automatically collect a variety of NOT personally identifiable information. You remain
anonymous and can opt-out of automatic data collection by disabling JavaScript on this website. To do so, access your
browser settings and there should be a button to disable JavaScript.
<h3 class="rem1">I collect the following:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Day visited, pages visited</li>
    <li>Location by city</li>
    <li>Clicks, scrolled to bottom (I wish to implement coordinates on these two to create UX heatmaps and determining
        how often someone reads the entire poem/story/article)</li>
    <li>Length of a browsing session on my website</li>
    <li>Links you clicked to access my website (social media, LinkedIn, etc.)</li>
    <li>Type of web browser, operating system</li>
    <li>Screen resolution</li>
    <li>Document downloads (PDFs, images)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="rem1">I do not collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>IP Addresses</li>
    <li>Names, emails, phone numbers, other personally identifiable information</li>
    <li>Keystrokes (This is very easy to implement and very easy to exploit. Be vigilant that other websites might track
        keystrokes and steal sensitive information if you accidentally type on their webpage.)</li>
    <li>Exact time visited, click locations</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="rem1-2">Local Storage</h2>
This website is served client-side, so I am unable to implement my own cookies. (Refer to the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">
    Google Analytics Cookie Policy</a>)
I use local storage to mimic past-state actions. For example, clicking “do not remind me again” on the privacy popup
will store a Boolean value that will
prevent the popup from showing. Local storage is private to you and none of it contains sensitive information. Local
storage data has no expiration time, so it will persist on your browser unless you clear all browsing data from the site
or your device. In contrast, cookies have expiration times and can track more dynamic state and memory of a website.

<h2 class="rem1-2">How Do I Use Your Information?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I use this data to assess my website engagement and traffic regarding my portfolio, writing, and journalism.
        <ul>
            <li>I would be checking the location of users that visit my portfolio to determine where potential
                recruiters are based in, as well as UX experience with accessing portfolio pages. </li>
            <li>For writing, I would check general engagement with what genre of posts get the most traffic. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I would use this information to create personal reports and stratagem to improve my website visits and see how
        many anonymous fans recurrently visit my website. </li>
    <li>Although I could infer who visits my website based on location, I will not pester you about visiting my website.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="rem1-2">Distribution of Collected Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will not share this information for commercial gain, but I might create educational reports to demonstrate how
        analytics can be used to improve user experience. Educational reports may be shared with interviewers and mock
        reports may be posted in educational articles.</li>
    <li>I will never include location in these reports to protect your and my privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="rem1-2">How Do I Protect Your Information?</h2>
I safeguard my hosting platform and my analytics account to protect your unidentifiable information. I do not collect
any personally identifiable information.
<h2 class="rem1-2">How Can You Contact Me?</h2>
For most of my visitors, I can be reached on social media. For potential recruiters, contact me on LinkedIn or fill out
my contact form.
