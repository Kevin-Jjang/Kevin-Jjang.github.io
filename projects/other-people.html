        <h4 id="op-overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong>: Among a large team of literary editors and designers, I am currently Other
            People's
            only developer. Therefore, my activities cover a broad range from Web Production to Digital Development to
            UX Design.</p>


        <h4 id="op-management">INTERNAL MANAGEMENT</h4>
        <h4 id="op-ux">UX Research & Design</h4>
        <h4 id="op-prod">Digital Magazine Production</h4>
        <p>Even though I have had access to the <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferer">Forestry.io</a>
            CMS to curate new posts for Collections, I prefer working directly in
            VSCode for efficiency. Forestry.io effectively allows the non-developers to create and manage front-matter.
            To provide more accessibility principles into their production, I added alt-text fields and instructed them
            where alt text goes.</p>
        <h4 id="op-dev">New Digital Art Development</h4>
        <p>Another benefit of using a code-based website is that developers can create anything! I have implemented a
            slideshow function for the homepage to showcase featured posts from the current Collection.</p>
        <p>In the upcoming year, I plan to develop dynamic, native interfaces for digital storytelling. Like manga
            readers,
            this would give users the chance to interact with the content and keep their focus on paragraphs at a time.
            The tone of the prose would be amplified by isolated text that pops out to the reader after every click
            through the dynamic reader.</p>
