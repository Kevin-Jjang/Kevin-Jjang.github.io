        <h4 id="op-overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p><strong>Other People Literary Magazine</strong>, established in 2019, is known as UC San Diego's first
            undergraduate-run literary magazine. Among a large team of literary editors and designers, I am currently
            Other
            People's only code-based developer. Therefore, my activities cover a broad range from Web Production to
            Digital Development to UX Design. I am constantly communicating with directors and members to accomplish all
            of the tasks needed to maintain and enhance our creative display of UCSD students' works on our website.</p>

        <p>My responsibilities are performed on GitHub (codebase), GitHub Pages (hosting), Jekyll (static site
            generator), Forestry.io (CMS), Miro (UX wireframes), and Webflow (UI layouts)</p>


        <h4 id="op-management">INTERNAL MANAGEMENT</h4>
        <p>I create architectural design records (ADRs) for any major change to the website. These ADRs are about
            something technical, yet I must write them in a way that the non-developer directors are able to understand.
            Therefore, I give context on the subject and describe the pros and cons of each decision option. These
            records document changes that happen in the website code and asserts responsibility onto my actions when
            making changes. ADRs are both stored in Markdown format within GitHub, as well as inside our Google Drive
            under our website folder.</p>

        <p>Other recording documents include a changelog within the GitHub repository for the minor updates that do not
            require decisions and a checklist of tasks that I need to complete by certain dates like a collection
            release.</p>
        <h4 id="op-ux">UX Research & Design</h4>
        <p>Using my previous experiences with UX Design, I fixed many accessibility issues concerning screen-reader and
            keyboard support. One of the biggest issues was an inaccessible navigation menu in the header. Pressing
            enter would not open the menu because it was a link instead of a button. Furthermore, links did not have a
            selection outline and tabbing past the link would fall into the hidden navigation elements, when it should
            tab to the main content. This happened because the navigation container was positioned outside the browser
            and did not hide the links inside it.</p>

        <p>To solve these problems, I changed the navigation link to a button so a user can use the keyboard to trigger
            the JavaScript function. I included the <code>display: none</code> style to effectively hide the contents of
            the navigation menu when it was closed. This solved the tabbing logic so the menu button would redirect to
            the content. These fixes solved the main issues with navigation, but the final issue was the select
            indicator around the menu button. Searching through the codebase, I identified and removed a
            <code>user-select: none</code> line that worked against accessibility principles. I understood that was done
            to secure the published posts from being copied, but it was still easy to select or screenshot the
            literature and art with that line of code.
        </p>

        <p>Other UX concerns include the search function because the codebase currently utilizes two different
            navigation menus. Landing pages contain the functional search bar directly in the menu, but posts contain a
            link to the search page instead of the search bar. The wireframe below details the difference between the
            two header implementations and the steps it takes to access the search function. This UX issue is still
            being considered by the directors. In the meantime, I am researching ways that would require a separate
            search page. Since the menu can be opened in any user approach, accessing this search function in the menu
            should not be a problem.</p>
        <h4 id="op-prod">Digital Magazine Production</h4>
        <p>My role has taken over the website production responsibility formerly held by my co-editor-in-chief. Since I
            have more experience with responsive Markdown/HTML/CSS and the Jekyll site generator, I can quickly curate
            quality posts for standalone content or a whole Collection. In addition, I use <code>br/, strong, em</code>
            instead of the Markdown syntax in case the content gets transferred to a different site generator that does
            not convert Markdown to HTML.</p>
        <p>Before I became the Web Producer, the website did not have Collection No. 2 uploaded for about four months. I
            was able to get all thirteen of the published posts uploaded, formatted, and proofread within eight hours of
            work! Collection No. 3 has not been released yet, but I already uploaded and formatted the fifteen posts in
            about three hours. The editorial process is still ongoing, so I would have to proofread the posts later in
            the final version before our release in Fall!</p>
        <p>Even though I have access to the <a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferer">Forestry.io</a>
            CMS to curate new posts for Collections. I was able to understand the CMS in an hour of reading through
            onboarding, reading its documentation and creating mock posts, but I prefer working directly in
            VSCode and Jekyll for efficiency. Forestry is slow with previewing new posts, so I run Jekyll locally to
            generate the preview within seconds. We use Forestry because it effectively allows the non-developers to
            create posts and manage the front-matter in a nice UI. The CMS is also headless, meaning that we can switch
            to a different CMS to connect to our content, if needed.</p>
        <h4 id="op-dev">New Digital Art Development</h4>
        <p>The benefit of using GitHub Pages to host our website is that it is entirely custom-coded. Therefore,
            developers can create anything without being constrained by head-based CMS! This grants us the freedom to
            develop art within digital media at the limits of our imagination!</p>

        <p>Since we are separated by distanced learning, I have not been able to ask everyone for creative ideas to
            build for the website. However, for Collection No. 3's upcoming release I have implemented a slideshow
            function for the homepage. The slideshow will showcase featured posts from the latest Collection and link
            directly to them. My UX design of this slideshow would more effectively indicate that we have a new
            Collection and makes the Issuu link stand out instead of having it always in the hidden navigation menu. The
            featured images will fill up the user's screen upon entering the website, so it is easier to see the artwork
            in comparison to the small image previews in the genre catalogues.</p>
        <p>In the upcoming year, when we return to campus, I plan to develop dynamic, native interfaces for digital
            storytelling and mixed media art. One idea takes the form of a fade-in-out storybook that would give users
            the chance to interact with the content and keep their focus on paragraphs at a time. The tone of the prose
            would be amplified by isolated text that pops out to the reader after every
            click through the dynamic reader.</p>
