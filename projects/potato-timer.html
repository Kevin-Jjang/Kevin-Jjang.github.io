        <h4 id="pt-overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p><strong>Potato Timer</strong> is a pomodoro timer built by a team of eight students taking CSE 110 Software
            Engineering at UC San Diego. Our pomodoro timer features language support for English, Spanish, Chinese, and
            Korean with keyboard and screen reader support. Tasks, time periods, and last language used are locally
            saved on your browser so that you can leave the page and come back with all of your tasks saved to work on
            again. We had specific roles we were assigned, such as two managers frontend, backend, QA, UI/UX design, and
            builder. I was UI design but ended up doing frontend and backend work after the minimum viable product was
            built. This was the first time that all but two of us worked with HTML/CSS/JS, but we were able to create
            this cool pomodoro timer within eleven weeks!</p>

        <p><strong>Tools</strong>: HTML/CSS/JS, NodeJS (Cypress testing), JSDocs, GitHub, GitHub Pages (hosting), Miro
            (Brainstorm and UX), Webflow (UI), Slack (communication)</p>

        <p><strong>Notable Contributions</strong>: The entire task system functionality, integrating language locality
            and keyboard and screen reader accessibility. Technically I ended up fulfilling any role by the end of the
            course by helping in both frontend (HTML/CSS), backend (JS), and Q/A testing (Cypress). The <a
                href="https://github.com/AlexisChen99/cse110-w21-group4/graphs/contributors">GitHub activity</a>
            gives a rough idea of my contributions, although half the commits were collaborative with the frontend or
            backend groups.</p>

        <h4 id="pt-intro">POTATO TIMER INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>The website contains several documents and videos to learn more about our Potato Timer project in general.
            The Specs folder contains relevant artifacts such as staged development screenshots, videos, ADRs, etc. that
            show the progress we made. I would watch the <a
                href="https://github.com/AlexisChen99/cse110-w21-group4/wiki/Demo-Videos">demo videos</a> first, read
            the <a href="https://github.com/AlexisChen99/cse110-w21-group4/blob/main/specs/users/EndUserDoc.md">End User

            then read the <a

                Doc</a> in that order to work through the project
            contents.
        </p>

        <p>My portfolio will cover my notable contributions among my team. I will not be covering user stories, coverage
            and QA testing, and backend work on the timer since I did not contribute significantly to those.</p>

        <h4 id="pt-ux">UX Accessibility Design</h4>
        <p>I did not write any user stories even though that work fits my literary background. Instead, my first
            experiences with HTML/CSS/JS were spent learning about these programming languages and the right practices
            to use them. I delved into WAI-ARIA research and learned about accessibility principles related to keyboards
            and screen readers, allowing me to provide accessibility within the frontend and backend functions. (<a
                href="https://youtu.be/NfJEp5RcOGs">DEMO Video</a>)</p>

        <p>I designed and developed a logical tabbable interface for our instruction and options menus so keyboard users
            can navigate the page without having to move backwards. In addition, each task contains different
            interactable buttons to support the task functionality In order to speed up a keyboard user’s control of the
            website, a skip anchor appears to move the focus to the next skip anchor. This tabbable logic allows one to
            keep pressing enter to skip a task rather than tabbing three times each.</p>

        <p>I was able to make the Potato Timer support screen readers in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. The
            essential part was to change the HTML language to the supported languages, but I also supported screen
            readers on buttons by adding the <code>aria-label</code> attribute to them. The <code>aria-label</code>
            attribute gives a description on a button’s purpose, and it is covered by a screen reader. To support this
            language locality, all the HTML elements that contain text or descriptions had to change into the new
            language. Therefore, I used JavaScript to write in the language from a JSON file to the HTML. I used
            Microsoft Narrator to test all four screen reader languages and verified that accents, buttons, and text
            were read properly.</p>

        <p>The final accessibility concern was colorblindness since one of our teammates was red-green colorblind and
            criticized how he could not see anything on a team’s purely red timer. While the light and dark themes
            account for colorblindness, the default theme of the timer is the potato background, so visually impaired
            users might be discouraged and automatically exit the timer instead of switching to these plain themes. </p>

        <p>Despite the potato theme distractions, our accessible pomodoro timer makes up for its UI and timer logic
            shortcomings since we were the only team to address accessibility among the other forty teams in the class.
            These accessibility features changed my perception of computer science because of the lack of such support.
            Even though I have no problems with visuals, audio, and connection my writing subjects are what influenced
            me to consider an audience that might have issues with digital space. As seen with my later projects, I
            constantly consider digital accessibility in any context from web apps to literary magazines.</p>

        <h4 id="pt-backend">BACKEND &mdash; TASK FUNCTION</h4>
        <p>The task function took a significant time to program, but we were able to make it work well after three weeks
            of intensive programming. The task function was mostly done in JavaScript by creating HTML elements to
            append to the DOM. There are two task containers: one on the main screen, and one under the tasks menu. The
            main screen contains a user’s pinned tasks, which involved appending a new task element to the DOM. Then the
            primary backend team connected the all task done logic to the timer’s end function and set the default
            pinned task display threshold when adding a user’s first tasks to the Potato Timer.</p>

        <p>The tabbable skip-task function was an innovative function that I thought was cooler than the task system
            itself. Consider the case when a user removes a task in the middle. All skip anchor links point to the task
            id + 1, but that removed task no longer exists and will result in a failed anchor! This also occurs with
            pinned tasks where the task’s id is copied, so usually there won’t be task id’s in order. This is addressed
            by calling a function that sets the skip-task anchors whenever a task is deleted or pinned. The function
            will take all of the DOM node elements in the container and retrieve the task’s id. The previous skip will
            point to the next task’s id no matter what it is, allowing the accessibility to work all the time.</p>

        <h4 id="pt-frontend">FRONTEND &mdash; MVP UI DESIGN</h4>
        <p>Our goals for the minimum viable product (MVP), a minimum working version of a program, was to have a
            minimalist design that supported both light and dark modes to allow users a comfortable daytime and
            nighttime view. I designed these MVPs that can still be seen in the final product by opening the options and
            changing the theme to light or dark.</p>

        <h4 id="pt-writing">EARLY CONTRIBuTIONS</h4>
        <p>I wrote most of the <a href="https://github.com/AlexisChen99/cse110-w21-group4/tree/main/specs/pitch">project
                pitch</a> because I had experience with writing technical reports in high school. The original pitch far
            exceeded the class’s page limit, so we had to cut it down to our first phase of development. </p>

        <p>After we decided on a project name, my artistic creativity gave me the urge to give the potato timer a
            backstory and a poem. It established some team culture that brought us together over the eleven weeks we
            had. Creativity entertains the workforce to keep on programming while having fun together!</p>
