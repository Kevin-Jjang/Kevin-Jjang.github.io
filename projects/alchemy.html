        <h4 id="alch-overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p><strong>Alchemy</strong> is a biannual literary translation journal with affiliation between the Linguistics
            and Literature departments at UC San Diego. This journal was established in 2012, reviewing translations
            from emerging to professional translators around the world. My involvement in Alchemy recently gained more
            importance as the Web Manager by redesigning the website and setting up and organizing submissions.

        <h4 id="alch-management">WEBSITE MANAGEMENT</h4>
        <h5 id="alch-redesign">REDESIGN</h5>

        <p>The website’s 2012 design felt dated, with a thin article space constrained by a bulky sidebar. The sidebar
            was redundant with many elements such as recent posts and the language tags were unbalanced. Having language
            tags grow by number of posts tagged would give off the impression that Spanish translations were the most
            accepted, so it might discourage other language submissions. The large text among smaller text also
            attracted attention away from the main article, so we wanted to de-clutter the landing pages. In addition,
            there was so much whitespace around the top and right margins of the webpage because of the black header and
            blocky sidebar. The main content looked smaller than it was, so modernizing the website would correct these
            issues.</p>

        <p>Alchemy does not have a design team, so it was rough for me to develop a UI and mood board for the website.
            Because WordPress has more constraints than vanilla coding, it was more convenient to browse for theme
            templates than to develop a WordPress theme from scratch. Therefore, I gathered several themes and held a
            team vote for the most pleasing one. Choosing a theme template has the benefits of monthly updates by the
            theme developer so that this team of non-developers were not dependent on a programmer to update the theme.
            In addition, Alchemy is hosted on the UCSD network so all technical changes had to go through IT support,
            which meant that building a theme would need to go through code-review for security. Since the WordPress
            themes we selected were official from WordPress, IT was able to approve the theme that we currently use
            since 2021.</p>

        <p>We chose a theme that uses a non-developer-friendly UI such that anyone could change it and see the change
            without any technical setup. This gives the added benefit that future redesigns can still use the current
            theme to create a different style and layout. This theme removes the cutter on landing pages and makes the
            header feel like it blends into the website. Now the cover image takes the attention of the user when they
            enter an issue page, instead of quickly shifting to that old sidebar. Most of the old sidebar’s components
            still exist but in different areas, such as a balanced language tag cloud, search bar, and social links in
            the footer.</p>

        <p>The sidebar is still found on post and blog pages, yet it is less “blocky” with an unconstrained look. This
            design makes the secondary tag cloud with categories to all issues and genres more freeform to occupy more
            of the webpage. We chose a 67% article, 33% sidebar layout for these pages to keep the sidebar not
            excessively long and the prose wide enough to occupy most of the screen. Poetry formats are not changed
            since we made the article space wider.</p>

        <p>In my analysis, the website is not as accessible as my work for Other People since I am not allowed to edit
            the theme’s code because of the UCSD network. The primary shortcoming of theme convenience is that buttons
            do not have screen-reader support and there are no hidden skip buttons to skip tabbing over the long tag
            clouds.</p>

        <h5 id="alch-internal">MANAGEMENT</h5>
        <p>The UCSD network puts several restraints on the backend WordPress CMS, so it was difficult for me to create
            and preview posts. Therefore, the previous editors would have had a harder time producing the published
            pages on the CMS. To provide more non-developer support to use the CMS, I applied for several popular
            plugins including page-building and SEO. The page-builders are helpful for previewing the post and one could
            edit the posts in a cleaner UI. </p>

        <p>Since Alchemy consists of non-developers that may not have strong knowledge of HTML and CSS, I have created
            an internal user guide to understand the CMS and ways to curate posts in a user-friendly manner. </p>

        <h4 id="alch-editorial">EDITORIAL WORK</h4>
        <p>Editing for a translation journal is interesting because of how translators work to translate from one
            language into another. We primarily focus on editing the English translation and have department chairs or
            friends verify translations because we will not know all the languages. However, I can identify most rhymes
            in Chinese and Korean due to language proficiency. I also learned to identify some rhymes in Romance
            languages by the suffixes or by reading it aloud. Through that knowledge, I have been able to discern when a
            translator introduced their own style into the translation by adding rhymes that should not be there. Other
            translators might take tradeoffs by disregarding the rhyme to create a clearer English translation. I must
            be attentive when reading translations to make sure the original author’s voice is heard and interpreted
            right, so that I can become a stronger editor in general. The presentation of language is a significant
            learning point that has been applicable to my UX design and documented code to translate concepts into
            something legible for others to understand.</p>
        <h5 id="alch-submissions">SUBMISSIONS (<a href="https://forms.gle/dZbEuSXQAEgfRSwJ7">DEMO FORM</a>)</h5>
        <p>Since the beginning of the journal’s establishment, submissions were collected by sending an email
            to us. It worked since we were able to get about the same number of submissions in those terms, but I
            thought that the information translators sent could have been improved upon.</p>

        <p>Instead of collecting by email, I implemented a Google Form for Summer 2021 because it was convenient at the
            time rather than requesting a Submittable account funded by the university. Google Forms did not appear to
            have any adverse effects on submissions since various email affiliations were able to submit through the
            form. The form also allowed us to automate the submission process by organizing submissions into a folder
            and recording the date of submission used to impose strict deadlines on our submissions period. This form,
            available when the submissions period is open, can quickly be found on the <a
                href="https://alchemy.ucsd.edu/submissions/">Submissions page</a> to draw attention on where to submit.
        </p>

        <p>Managing the submission process for Summer 2021 has taught me more about what users submit in our new
            submission form implementation. From the submissions currently being edited, I realized that there are vague
            questions on the form such as “Prose” not differentiating between fiction and nonfiction pieces. Getting
            more information about the translator’s process is also important since we would like to know if
            translations were autotranslated or not. Other enhancements might include art composition for alt text and
            caption descriptions. I have learned from these mistakes and will redo our submission form to be more
            concise with our translators.</p>
