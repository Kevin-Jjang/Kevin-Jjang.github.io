            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Kevin Jang is a third-year undergraduate majoring in computer science and minoring in creative writing at
                University of California, San Diego. He is more likely to be found associating with students in the
                literature department than with his affiliated CSE department. When he is not bouncing around the various literary magazines on campus, his main hobbies are writing poetry,
                learning about femininities and masculinities, and exercising!</p>
            <p>Kevin is also a member of the UCSD Dragon Boat team because of his persistence and drive to learn more
                about his cultural heritage through a competitive and full-body paddling sport. Although he has never
                participated in an official race due to the pandemic, he continues to exercise to rocket the team
                forward once they reconvene on campus this Fall.</p>
