<h1>Poetry</h1>

<main class="content-container">
    <p>I have had an interest in poetry since I was eight, but I started writing my own poems in 2017. I write around
        seventy poems a year, where the metaphors bombard and mature my mind into a broader set of subjects and genres.
        Ironically, I do not write about coding as to separate the stressor with the destressor. As I carve an
        interdisciplinary pathway into computer science and writing during college, I wish to engage in digital poetics
        through the dynamic, accessible display of typographical layouts and dimensionality.</p>
    <p>I do not submit prose in organizations I work at to reduce bias. Instead, I have an tradition of submitting to
        one unique organization per year.</p>
    <p>This blog shall be updated with my own selected poetry and essays when I don't have school :)</p>

                <li>Note: My name is misspelled in the Zine as "Kevin Wang". In my current work as editor and producer,
                    I actively avoid such situations by contacting the writer or artist to confirm publication of their
                    piece. I have experienced many cases of misspelled names from various languages during editorial
                    work at Alchemy, so I check every name to make sure they are spelled right.</li>
