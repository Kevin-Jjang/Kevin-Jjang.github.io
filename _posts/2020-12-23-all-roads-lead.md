To You at Station Two
Waiting for the sleepy train 
To cradle into an erratic yawn,
But I have found you at last
Over glittery seas and glistening sands
Over the endless greens and the bustling scenes,
I could only shout your name
Echoing out of this dreamy tunnel
Because I can't believe that it's you,
With tears already in your eyes
No matter where you are
The train departs from Station You.
