Taking care of something is no easy task. Imagine you're heading to Ralph's to do the infinite green onion exploit: you pick out the healthiest-looking bundle of $1 scallions and swiftly take the open self-checkout station to register your commitment to this mission. Back at your apartment, you unsheathe your only kitchen knife and chop down the scallions to their roots, leaving a thin base the size of your pinky nail. It's a foundation—a clean slate for new growth.

You put the roots in a small sauce cup you got from one of those fast food places you ate at within the last two weeks. Only a few drops of water is enough to tickle the roots of the plant. Having saved the base from a wilting demise, the scallions appreciate the small act of kindness. They don't trust you fully—intuitively they know you cut into their life; regardless, they wave back at you. You wave back at them. 

A few days of careful watering, enough to keep the scallions sated but not overwhelmed by your love, their heads start to peek out. You see more of their white rings over their lifetime, their happy green growth rising to the sky, their roots wiggling for a hug.

So you give them one—a hug they wouldn't want to let go of. You lift them off their feet, spinning them around in joy as you gently wrap your fingers around their precious torso, basking in the morning sunlight as you set them back down in a new warmth. The scallions sway back and forth in the new shoes you bought them, loving the front-row seat atop the balcony beam. They watch you from afar, confident that you'll feed them every other day.

But some days you'll get busy, and can't water your green onions. You begin to forget that they're there, even though they are nervously waiting for you to pour attention over them. The green in their cheeks escapes, frowning into their shoes. Others notice, flying towards the saddened plant and picking away at their weakened state. They draw a web around your scallion's limbs, daring to steal your plant. This stirs a great buzz that catches your attention the next time you're in their neighborhood. 

You step into action, unconditionally giving your onions all your love. You take them back home, peeling away the broken edges so they don't infect the heart. They start tearing up at the edges—only slightly as to not perturb your thorough care. Your scallion is alright now, but won't see you the same for weeks.

This is the side arc you want to avoid. There's no need to put them through such neglect. You also don't want to hurt them. You might want to harvest their precious life now that they've fully shown themselves to you in their beautiful light, but that's a fatal mistake. You'd be reversing months of hard work all for your own satisfaction. Think about how they feel! 

Now it's almost the second summer, and you didn't know what would happen next. Your plant opens their heart and confesses their deepest secret to you. They love you and show you the beauty hidden inside them. You pay special attention to them, watching them bloom into an awesome flowering plant. They bolt into your life and you don't want to hurt them thereafter. That is the story of the infinite green onion family. 

Why exploit one plant, unsure of their future, when you can nurture one with special treatment to the point that you'll have them forever? That is what taking care of your significant other and special people should be like. After all the love you give them, one day they may show that they love you too.
