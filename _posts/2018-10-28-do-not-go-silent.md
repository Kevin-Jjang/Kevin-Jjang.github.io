---
Do not go silent into that quiet light,
Young life should scream and shout every day;
Yell, yell against the lonely life.
 
Though disillusioned people know solitude is right,
Because their words had no importance they
Do not go silent into that quiet strife.
 
Rejected loves, the worst case, end their strife
That caring arms might have erased today,
Yell, yell against the lonely life.
 
Insane people who prayed and howled the moon in flight,
And learn, too far gone, they made it this way,
Yell, yell against the lonely life.
 
Widowed, in bed, suffering day and night
A heart could explode like a bomb and be saved,
Yell, yell against the lonely life.
 
And you, my friend, there on that joyful height,
Talk, text, help me now with your lively face, I say!
Do not go silent into that quiet strife.
Yell, yell against the lonely life.
