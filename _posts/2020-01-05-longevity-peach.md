The grandfather was ill from living years ahead
Of even the oldest passing elder;
His eyes had failed from years of crystallized residue,
With spotty skin but no wrinkles on his face.

His granddaughter always fed him a peach for lunch,
Golden ones with large pits that he used to grind between his molars
Like a nut that his frail jaws couldn't clamp upon;
But he always smiled when she came to feed her a peach.

Winter was coming, the peaches had to be picked;
But a great storm intruded and plucked all the fruit from the nest.
The house was getting cold and the grandfather slumped into his pillow,
Coughing and wheezing from the oncoming season.

The granddaughter went to town to buy some medicine, 
Passing the vast marshlands of laborers in pointed hats;
She saw the aged wrinkly skin of working the annual seasons
And wondered if she would befall that fate.

The herbalist lived at the edge of town—
A vibrant fragrance of jasmine and chamomile drifted through the air
Like the crane spreading its wings for its young;
The granddaughter made her entrance to the source of such calmness.

The herbalist prescribed her an assortment of plants:
Ginkgo, cinnamon, ginger, ginseng, and lotus seed.
The daughter was familiar to each, yet she had to ask
But lotus isn't a medicinal plant!

The herbalist smiled, 
For prosperity and longevity, 
That is the way of the lotus.
She sent the granddaughter off to care for Grandfather.

The laborers were packing their ragged bags to go home,
Their necks pink from the rays and hands raw from the chaff.
She briskly walked home before the sun set,
Which was sleeping on the tip of the highest mountain.

She returned to feed her grandfather a bowl of rice, 
Letting him fall soundly asleep before preparing to cook.
She threw all the herbs except the seeds into a pot
And boiled them up into a stew.

She looked at the seeds at the bottom of her basket,
Wondering what she could make;
A small, dried pit rolled and bumped her foot.
She knew exactly what to create.

The granddaughter took the seeds and grounded them up into a fine paste,
Breaking out the dough and distributing the paste onto each fine circle.
She curled the dough into a ball and pinched the ends of them,
Sprinkling them with rose powder before putting them in the stone oven.

The moon was high in the sky, 
Owls hooted and cranes hid under the moonlight;
The granddaughter was tired and laid down;
Forgetting that the baos were still in the kiln. 

The granddaughter woke up at dawn, the ashy smell of cinders still in the air.
Her eyes pried loosely, and gasped at her mistake. 
In the oven were two dozen buns, lukewarm yet looked perfect
Even after being left unchecked for too long.

The grandfather started a coughing fit,
To which the granddaughter rushed to serve him tea and medicine. 
He nodded his head and smiled sadly, his hands shaking from the cold.
He asked for a peach, but there were none to give.

The granddaughter returned to the oven and put a bun on a plate;
It was definitely smaller, but looked like a white peach.
She topped the pink surface with a peach leaf
And served the substitute to her grandfather.

The grandfather said that it was softer than a peach,
That the taste was less sweet yet bore a pasty consistency;
Nonetheless he could feel the peach leaf,
Concluding that it was still a peach.

He smiled even wider, his eyes opening a little more;
He seemed to sense his granddaughter looking down on him;
He could feel the cold sensation of the tears that ran down her cheeks,
All without having to lift an arm, nor having to listen to her footfalls.

The grandfather went back to sleep with a deep sigh,
Snoring softly as his body remained warm from the tea,
Yet his heart grew strong as the lotus wrapped its petals around the soul,
And helped him live a little while longer.
