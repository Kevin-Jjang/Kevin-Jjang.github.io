I’m sorry, but your efforts have gone down the drain.
It's time I told you you're the one I need not;
It's not you, it's not me — it's just that you’re so profane.
I just felt that our time was just a thought.

Don't get the wrong idea, but I still like you as a friend,
Of the fun and pleasure that goes unmeasured
Frolicking through the trees and the tentative trends.
But alas, I can't accept your love that I treasured.

You stood out from the ones I considered intimate,
In ways that I liked or found distastefully sound.
I felt that you shouldn’t get rid if it
Even if it didn’t make you round.

I hope I can make up to satisfy your perpetual devotion;
Maybe we can watch the sun set on our transient
connection?
