Rippling furrows curl up and out,
Like a pulsing droplet on a waterspout;
Dancing on the edge of water and air
Graceful gliding ballerinas drift there.
The umbra bell ebbing with the flow,
Sinking deeper into the abysmal low. 

Silk cloth loose around the shoulders,
The entrancing sight thus smolders
Those armed teeth with swords,
Knowing the fierce sting of a thousand lords.
Tentacles welcoming with open frays
Unto a treat of deadly embrace.

Bayside drains abandon these wretches
To their rampant, unchecked conquests.
Bloating bodies of Medusa’s spawn
Slither and squeeze through the slimy bronze.
Trouble, trouble, yonder port to starboard toss!
The sea of will o’ wisps float en masse!

The wave breaks whip the Man-of-Mors,
Fizzing froth on still gelatinous flesh.
Merciful Earth battle these foes!
Drive them under sandy throes!
The umbra bell ebbing with the flow,
Sinking deeper into the abysmal low. 


With every brush of potent toxicity 
The tentacles shed their skin promiscuously.
There’s no denying what has come true:
The filaments drift aimlessly into the blue.
Tentacles welcoming with open frays
Unto a treat of deadly embrace.

Circulating around the Pacific Gyre
Like a whirlpool for the jellies to conspire.
Tangled in a putrid, filmy mattress
Spanning from sunrise, lest to sunset.
Trouble, trouble, yonder port to starboard toss!
The sea of will o’ wisps float en masse!
 
An immortal life cycle of proliferation,
The gel never dissolving from acidification,
Creatures growl from their rocky lairs,
Jellies lining the fleshy beds with filmy hairs.
The umbra bell ebbing with the meek,
Sinking deeper into the abysmal beak. 

Needles pierce the slightest curiosity calling,
Choking thy lungs to a salty drowning.
The ravenous turtle scarfs a lonesome jelly,
Swallowing the bell of Mors’s hell—
Loops devouring with open face
Unto a treat of deadly lace.

Translucent ghosts glowing like blood,
The nuclear bioluminescence remains buried in mud;
Chemicals seeping into the waters,
Poison to the whales, corals, and otters—
Trouble, trouble, yonder port to starboard boss???
The sea of immortal bags float en masse!!!
