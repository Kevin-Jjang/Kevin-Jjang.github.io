&ensp;Lightly as the down passing between me and the sun,
I speed down this route, going north for some fun;
The wishbone form of those cranes fly south as one,
Synced,&ensp;clamorous whooping in their Native tongue.

A wisp of cloud kisses the sky, leaving it dry;
As the common oak looks so spry, so fly;
Wearing that dress of cheese and needs,
It&ensp;drops late kernels of seeds and leaves.

&ensp;As my odometer ticks its thousandth mile,
The chilly air tickles my squinting smile;
The rustling leaves applaud my grand
With frostbitten stubs for hands.

I glide along the glossy golden line
On this smooth pavement, a telltale sign.
The Olympiad bike rattles and clicks
Down the sloped â€˜side, hopping over&ensp;nicks.

For every pedal, the fruitful acorns detract,
&ensp;Banging my helmet between my flesh, the steel,
While the natural chestnut in my palm reacts,
&ensp;Delivering my soul beyond this Pennsylvanian wheel.
