The swift sword sunders the music in twain,
Fleeing keys shake jazzy tunes as they prance away
From the beehive netting of that sticky beatbox
Smiling towards the sunset of a wearisome day.

The chunky rook in his startled plight hunches
Over his broken enclosure, this melodramatic tragedy
Swells a sultry saltwater whine all over his lids.
The dry streams couldn't stay dry forever.

Sheesh! How that shifty rat wiggles his nicked ears,
Stretching that mischievous grin in the shadows
Where the smell of sweaty adventurers stick to leaves.
His brandished scimitar tastes his snickers gone sour.

But the hero! Patches of wool disguise the bruiser's
Stony upbringing in the ponds, where that godly blade
Hammered in water glows heavenly exonerating,
Banishing the evil lurking in those low bushes.

His long face freezes the slowed
&emsp;&emsp;stasis, as if to spit
"You could've switched the tune
&emsp;&emsp;if you didn't like it!"
