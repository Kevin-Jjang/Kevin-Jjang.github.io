The Easter green is rife with flowers
Simply blooming a seed of dreams,
I wish all fruit pretend as lovers
Yearn bright moments under the seams.
We dance the Spring's dashing ambience
For while hearts cry for day's transience;
Let's take our hands together closed
And clasp passion under our clothes.
She teases my smile with boundless kindness
Sprinkling delight across the lea
Where blossoms dare follow the sea;
We waltz among sunny morn's litheness.
Her eyes display mirth&mdash;endless life!
My soul is yours, my fearless wife~
