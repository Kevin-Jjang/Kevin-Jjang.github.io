When puddles dry succinctly into air,<br />
The traceless cracks defined upon my cheeks<br />
Recall the evening dusk, a glass of lights<br />
Consumed, the stray withdrawn atop the bed.

The Sunshine Showers come at early dawn<br />
When nobody stirs in bluish dressing gowns.<br />
As birds may chirp before the gentle wave,<br />
This tearful owl transformed into the sprout.

The Sunshine Showers bathe my wilted construct<br />
Finessed in the planter box, of which imbued<br />
Cyclones will gladly wash away the salt<br />
Encrusted upon my chubby petals thence.

The Sunshine Showers waking, healing me.<br />
The Sunshine Showers heat away my Dew.
