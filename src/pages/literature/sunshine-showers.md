When puddles dry succinctly into air,
The traceless cracks defined upon my cheeks
Recall the evening dusk, a glass of lights
Consumed, the stray withdrawn atop the bed.

The Sunshine Showers come at early dawn
When nobody stirs in bluish dressing gowns.
As birds may chirp before the gentle wave,
This tearful owl transformed into the sprout.

The Sunshine Showers bathe my wilted construct
Finessed in the planter box, of which imbued
Cyclones will gladly wash away the salt
Encrusted upon my chubby petals thence.

The Sunshine Showers waking, healing me.
The Sunshine Showers heat away my Dew.
